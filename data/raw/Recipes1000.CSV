5821,cinnamon babka,"bake tender, delicious homemade cinnamon filled babka with this tested recipe and illustrated step by step photo tutorial.","2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast, 3 tbsp granulated sugar, , 2/3 cup whole milk, , 5 tbsp unsalted butter, , 1 1/2 tbsp vegetable oil, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 4 egg yolks, 2 1/2 3 1/4 cups all purpose flour, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 cup dark brown sugar, 1/4 cup all purpose flour, 3 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 2 tbsp unsalted butter, , 1 egg white, 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, 1/4 cup all purpose flour, 2 tbsp unsalted butter, , 1/4 tsp salt","to prepare the dough start by dissolving the yeast in the warm milk along with 1 tsp sugar . if you do not have a thermometer, the milk should be warm to the touch but not hot . whisk the yeast and 1 tsp sugar into the milk to dissolve . over the next few minutes, the milk/yeast mixture should become foamy as the yeast begins to grow . if it doesn't, this likely means that your yeast has expired or the milk was too hot, causing it to die . get some fresh yeast and try again, otherwise your babka won't rise... and that would be a major bummer . while the yeast proofs, cream together the butter and sugar in a stand mixer fit with the paddle attachment . once the butter and sugar are well combined, add the oil and vanilla extract and mix well at low speed . add egg yolks 1 at a time and increase the mixer to high . beat for an additional 2 minutes . turn the mixer back to low speed and add 2 1/2 cups flour and 1 tsp salt, then add the foamy yeast mixture . be sure to give the yeast mixture a final whisk before adding it in, especially if it is very foamy . mix until just combined, then replace the paddle attachment with the dough hook . continue to mix, adding 1 tbsp of flour at a time, just until a soft dough forms . the amount of flour you need will vary based on humidity levels best to add flour slowly and check texture as you go.you want a dough that is soft a pliable, not stiff . the dough should be tacky, but not wet or sticky, and shouldn't cling to the skin . do not walk away during this part, you also want to keep an eye on the dough to make sure that you do not over mix it . it should be easy to form into a smooth ball . once a soft dough forms that can easily be removed from the hook by hand, transfer it to a lightly floured surface and knead several times, or until you have a smooth ball of dough . do not over knead . place the ball of dough into a greased mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap . i prefer to let the dough rise in the refrigerator overnight, but if you prefer you can let it rise at room temperature for 1 2 hours, or until it has just about doubled in size . to prepare the cinnamon filling combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl until smooth . set aside . remove the dough from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature, about 1 hour . once the dough reaches room temperature, roll it on a lightly floured surface until you have a 14x18 inch rectangle . evenly spread the cinnamon filling over the dough, leaving an even 1 inch border around the edge . starting with the long side, roll the dough into a tight log . roll the log back and forth several times, gently spreading it out until the length of the log is about 20 inches . twist the dough into a figure 8 and pinch the ends together . sometimes using a bit of water will help the ends to stick . line your loaf pan with parchment paper, then lightly spray the parchment with nonstick cooking oil spray . transfer the dough to the lined loaf pan . cover the pan with a tea towel, or loosely with plastic wrap, and allow to rise for 1 hour, or until the babka completely fills the pan . it will get pretty big while the dough is rising, prepare the streusel by combining the ingredients in a mixing bowl until well combined and crumbly . once the dough has risen, preheat oven to 350 degrees f.using a very thin skewer, poke a few holes into the babka . this allows steam to be released during baking so that you aren't left with very large gaps between the dough and the filling . brush the babka with an egg wash made from 1 egg white and 1 tbsp of whole milk . sprinkle the streusel over the top of the babka . it will collect more in the crevices, but this is fine . babka should have a rustic look . place the pan on a baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes, then turn the pan 180 degrees and cook for an additional 25 to 30 minutes, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 185 degrees f in the thickest center part of the babka . the babka will be golden brown and should have a hollow sound when tapped . allow the babka to cool before slicing . this is truly the hardest part of the whole process, but trust me cutting into it while it's still hot will leave you with quite a mess . the filling needs time to set up a bit . even after cooling it will crumble a bit when you slice it . that's part of the charm . serve with coffee or tea and enjoy your babka bliss"

1/4 cup white granulated sugar, 1/4 cup canola oil, 2 large eggs, 3/4 tsp vanilla extract, 18 ounces unbleached all purpose flour, 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp vodka, , 1 1/4 cup fruit jelly or jam, 3 pints oil with high smoke point for frying, 1/2 cup powdered sugar for dusting","pour active dry yeast into a small mixing bowl with 1/4 cup of the lukewarm water or milk and 1 tbsp of the sugar, whisk together to dissolve the yeast and sugar . wait 10 minutes . the yeast should activate during this time, making it look expanded and foamy . if it doesn't, your yeast may have expired make sure you work with fresh yeast before proceeding, or the dough won't rise . if yeast is foamy, whisk in the remaining 1/2 cup of lukewarm water or milk, remaining 3 tbsp granulated sugar, 1/4 cup canola oil, 2 large eggs, and 3/4 tsp vanilla extract . set aside . fit your stand mixer with the dough attachment . in your mixer bowl, sift together 18 ounces of flour and 1 tsp salt so they are well mixed . pour in the wet ingredients yeast mixture . set stand mixer to low speed and mix the wet ingredients together with the dry for 10 full minutes, until a very sticky dough forms . the dough will come together, but will stick to the bottom of the mixing bowl . if the dough seems dry, add a little more water, a tablespoon at a time, until the texture becomes sticky . alternatively, if the dough seems too wet, add a little more flour . add 1 tbsp of liquor vodka, brandy, ouzo or arak and continue to process on low for 2 3 additional minutes until the dough comes together again it should look sticky but not overly wet . at first, after adding the liquor, it may seem very wet don't worry, it should continue to come together after 2 3 minutes and return to a more sticky, doughy texture . grease a large mixing bowl with a little of the cooking oil, then scoop the sticky dough into the bowl . cover with a clean slightly damp tea towel and let the dough rise for roughly 2 hours until it doubles in size . it may take even longer than 2 hours go by the size . it should really double in size and look big and poofy.lightly flour a baking sheet and set to the side . flour a solid flat surface like a cutting board large enough for rolling out the dough . take the dough out of the bowl, place it on the floured surface, and flour the top of the dough as well . use a rolling pin to gently roll the dough out into a rough circle about 1/2 inch thick . proceed carefully, as you can easily roll it too thin . it should be gently stretched . make sure you use plenty of flour on top and bottom, loosening the dough as you roll to keep it from sticking . dip your circular cookie cutter in flour lightly, then starting at the outer edge of the dough, cut a circle by pushing down firmly and twisting slightly . as each circle is cut, remove it from the larger dough circle, scoop it up with a small spatula, and place it gently on the prepared floured baking sheet . when the dough has no room for circles left, re roll it to 1/2 inch thickness and cut circles again, repeating the process until you've cut as many circles as you can from the dough . lightly dust the tops of the circles with flour . cover the circles gently with a clean dry tea towel and let them rise for about 45 minutes longer . while sufganiyot are rising, add roughly 1 1/4 cups of strawberry jam to a squeeze bottle . if your jam has chunks of fruit or seeds in it, you will want to run it through a strainer before adding it to the bottle to ensure it squeezes smoothly into the sufganiyot . if straining the jam, you'll need roughly double the amount 2 1/2 cups to end up with the proper amount of strained jam . in a 5 quart saute pan or 6 quart pot, heat frying oil to 325 degrees f, using a candy thermometer to measure the heat . be careful not to let the oil get hotter than this or you run the risk of cooking the outside of the sufganiyot while the inside remains raw . the oil should be bubbling very lightly when the sufganiyot are added.using a small spatula or flat knife, transfer the circles one at a time into the hot oil, flipping them gently as you place them in the oil so that the puffy top side is facing downward into the oil . transfer up to 4 circles at a time into the oil . let them fry for about 90 seconds, or until golden brown on the bottom . gently flip them to continue frying on the other side for another 90 seconds roughly 3 minutes total, until the sufganiyot are nicely browned on both sides . if your oil cools a bit it may take slightly longer.transfer cooked sufganiyot to a wire rack or a parchment lined baking sheet to drain of oil . continue frying in batches of 4 until all of the sufganiyot are cooked . wait until the sufganiyot have cooled slightly before starting the filling process they can still be somewhat warm, but should not be hot . use a straw to tunnel into each sufganiyot, creating a narrow hollow hole in the top center of the pastry . use the squeeze bottle to squeeze jam into the center of each sufganiyot, just until the jam slightly overflows the hole in the center . dust with sugar just prior to serving . pour powdered sugar into a mesh strainer . gently dust each sufganiyot with powdered sugar, coating with a nice layer of white sugar . the jam dots in the center will soak up the sugar, leaving you with a pretty dollop of red jam in a couple of minutes . serve . sufganiyot are best served fresh the powdered sugar will soak into the doughnut over time, and it will appear soggy . you can also freeze the

sugar, and yeast into a large bowl, whisk till combined . let mixture rest for 10 minutes . the yeast should have activated, meaning it will look expanded and foamy . if it doesn't, your yeast may have expired, which means your bread won't rise go buy some fresh yeast whisk in canola oil, salt, and egg and beat till well combined . begin adding the flour to the bowl by half cupfuls, stirring with a large spoon each time flour is added . when mixture becomes too thick to stir, use your hands to knead . continue to add flour and knead the dough until it's smooth, elastic, and not sticky . the amount of flour you will need to achieve this texture varies only add flour until the dough feels pliable and ""right.""place a saucepan full of water on the stove to boil . meanwhile, remove the dough from your mixing bowl and wash out the bowl . grease the bowl with vegetable oil . push the dough back into the bottom of the bowl, then flip it over so that both sides are slightly moistened by the oil . cover the bowl with a clean, damp kitchen towel . place the bowl of dough on the middle rack of your oven . take the saucepan full of boiling water and place it below the rack where your dough sits . close the oven, but do not turn it on . the pan of hot water will create a warm, moist environment for your dough to rise . if it's a cold day, you can also heat the oven for 2 3 minutes till it's warm inside not hot . let the dough rise for 1 hour . take the dough bowl out and punch it down several times to remove air pockets.place it back inside the oven and let it rise for 1 hour longer . take the dough out of the oven . flour a smooth surface like a cutting board . punch the dough down into the bowl a few times, then turn the dough out onto the floured surface . knead for a few minutes, adding flour as needed to keep the dough from feeling sticky . now it's time to braid your challah . for challah braiding instructions, click here . i highly recommend you make two small braids with your dough, because later you will have to immerse the braids in boiling water . it is easiest to manage two small braids, rather than one large one . for this blog, i made two 4 strand braids, which worked out great . two 3 strand braids will work, as will round challah shapes . i do not recommend making 6 strand braids, it would be difficult with the small amount of dough you're working with . mini challah rolls are fun, too line a large cookie sheet with a clean, dry, smooth kitchen towel . place the braids on top of the towel and let them rise for 30 45 minutes longer . you'll know the dough is ready to bake when you press your finger into the dough and the indentation stays, rather than bouncing back . preheat oven to 350 degrees f . bring 4 quarts of water to boil in an oval saucepan or roasting pan on your stovetop . the pan should be large, with an opening wide enough to immerse the entire challah . dissolve the baking soda and 1/2 cup brown sugar into the boiling water, using a whisk to break up the baking soda and sugar that settles on the bottom of the pan . careful, the baking soda will fizz up when you add it to the boiling water bring the cookie sheet to the stove area . gently immerse the two braids in the boiling water for 30 seconds . turn them once with a spatula to make sure both sides of the braid are evenly moistened by the boiling water . use the spatulas to carefully remove the braids from the water and place them on the kitchen towel lined cookie sheet . if you prefer, you can immerse the braids one at a time for easier handling . let the soaked braids rest on the kitchen towel for a few minutes while you prepare your egg wash . they will look slightly ""water logged"" and pruney at this point, but don't worry, they'll puff up again when they bake . the kitchen towel will soak up any excess liquid so the bottom of each challah doesn't become soggy.to prepare the egg wash, whisk together the yolk, water, sugar and salt till smooth . line another baking sheet, or two half sheets, with parchment paper or, you can gently remove the challahs from the baking sheet and dry that one, then re use it . sprinkle the parchment paper with a light dusting of cornmeal . pretzel bread is sticky business doubling up with parchment paper and cornmeal is the safest bet to ensure that the challahs don't stick . place the braided challahs onto the parchment paper lined baking sheet s .brush the challahs evenly with a light, thorough coating of the egg wash . dust the challahs with kosher or coarse salt to taste . careful, they can get very salty very fast a thin, even sprinkling will work best.the challah needs to bake for about 30 40 minutes total, but to get the best result the baking should be done in stages . first, set your timer to 15 minutes and put your challah in the oven . after 15 minutes, take the challah out of the oven and coat the center of the braid with another very thin layer of egg wash . this area tends to expand during baking, exposing areas that will turn white unless they are coated with egg wash . don't lay it on too thick, or the egg will scramble just a thin layer will do it.turn the tray around, so the opposite side is facing front, and put the tray back into the oven . turning the tray helps your challah brown evenly the back of the oven is usually hotter than the front . the challah will need to bake for 15 25 minutes longer . challah is finished when it's a dark golden brown color all the way across . test the bread for doneness by turning it over and tapping on the bottom of the loaf if it makes a hollow sound, it's done . to keep the outer part of the pretzel challah soft and supple, you can brush each challah with a tablespoon of melted butter or margarine as soon as it comes out of the oven if you use butter, it becomes a dairy dish, not pareve . this step is optional.let challah cool slightly on the baking sheet or a wire cooling rack before serving . pretzel challah is best served warm reheat before serving . store it wrapped tightly in plastic wrap or foil to keep it fresh."

2667,buttery hamantaschen,"learn to make buttery hamantaschen dough, easy to work with for any filling . rich, delicious, orange scented cookies . kosher, dairy.","3/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature, 2/3 cup sugar, 1 large egg, room temperature, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp grated orange zest, 2 1/4 cups flour, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 5 tsp water if needed","slice room temperature butter into small chunks and place in a large mixing bowl . add sugar to the bowl . use an electric mixer to cream the butter and sugar together for a few minutes till light and fluffy . add the egg, vanilla, and orange zest to the bowl . beat again till creamy and well mixed . sift flour and salt into the bowl.mix with the electric mixer on low speed till a crumbly dough forms . begin to knead dough with hands till a smooth dough ball forms . try not to overwork the dough, only knead till the dough is the right consistency . if the crumbles are too dry to form a smooth dough, add water slowly, 1 teaspoon at a time, using your hands to knead the liquid into the dough . knead and add liquid until the dough is smooth and slightly tacky to the touch not sticky, with a consistency that is right for rolling out . it can easily go from the right consistency to too wet/sticky, so add water very slowly . if the dough seems too wet, knead in a little flour till it reaches the right texture . form the dough into a flat disk and wrap in plastic wrap . place in the refrigerator to chill for 3 hours to overnight . before you begin to assemble the hamantaschen, choose and make your filling and have it on hand to work with . preheat oven to 350 degrees f . lightly flour a smooth, clean surface . unwrap the dough disk and place it on the floured surface . the dough will be very firm after chilling . use a rolling pin to roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thick . at the beginning, it will be tough to roll out you may need to pound it a bit . a heavy rolling pin works best . as you roll, cracks may form on the edges of the dough . repair any large cracks with your fingers and continue rolling.when the dough reaches 1/4 inch thickness, scrape the dough up with a pastry scraper, lightly reflour the surface, and flip the dough over . continue rolling the dough out very thin less than 1/8 of an inch thick . the thinner you roll the dough, the more delicate and crisp the cookies will turn out just make sure that the dough is still thick enough to hold the filling and its shape if you prefer a thicker, more doughy texture to your cookies less delicate, keep the dough closer to 1/4 inch thick . lightly flour the rolling pin occasionally to prevent sticking . use a 3 inch cookie cutter not smaller or the 3 inch rim of a glass to cut circles out of the dough, cutting as many as you can from the dough.gather the scraps and roll them out again . cut circles . repeat process again if needed until you've cut as many circles as you can from the dough . you should end up with around 35 circles unless you've kept your dough on the thicker side, which will result in less cookies . place a teaspoon of filling whichever filling you choose into the center of each circle . do not use more than a teaspoon of filling, or you run the risk of your hamantaschen opening and filling spilling out during baking . cover unused circles with a lightly damp towel to prevent them from drying out while you are filling . assemble the hamantaschen in three steps . first, grasp the left side of the circle and fold it towards the center to make a flap that covers the left third of the circle.grasp the right side of the circle and fold it towards the center, overlapping the upper part of the left side flap to create a triangular tip at the top of the circle . a small triangle of filling should still be visible in the center . grasp the bottom part of the circle and fold it upward to create a third flap and complete the triangle . when you fold this flap up, be sure to tuck the left side of this new flap underneath the left side of the triangle, while letting the right side of this new flap overlap the right side of the triangle . this way, each side of your triangle has a corner that folds over and a corner that folds under it creates a ""pinwheel"" effect . this method if folding is not only pretty it will help to keep the cookies from opening while they bake . pinch each corner of the triangle gently but firmly to secure the shape . if any cracks have formed at the places where the dough is creased, use the warmth of your fingers to smooth them out.repeat this process for the remaining circles . when all of your hamantaschen have been filled, place them on a lightly greased baking sheet, evenly spaced . place them in the oven and let them bake at 350 degrees for 10 25 minutes, until the cookies are cooked through and lightly golden . start checking them at 10 minutes because the dough thickness tends to vary on these cookies they can cook quite fast if rolled thin . in most ovens it will take around 15 20 minutes, but best to keep a close watch over them as they cook to avoid overcooking or burning.cool the cookies on a wire rack . store them in a tightly sealed plastic bag or tupperware."
